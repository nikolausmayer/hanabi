# Hanabi 花火
A C++ implementation of [Hanabi by Ryoichi Ogura](https://www.spoon-tamago.com/2013/09/06/laser-cutter-design-contest-winners-announced/), a moiré pattern toy. I have been fascinated by its simplicity and how perfectly its concept matches vector graphics, so I have been wanting to write my own ever since learning of the hardware version.

# Usage
Just run `hanabi` and have fun.

# Building
Just `make`. This pulls the dependencies [CImg](http://cimg.eu/), [AGG](https://github.com/nikolausmayer/AntiGrainGeometry-v2.4) and [FLTK](https://www.fltk.org/), so the first build takes a bit longer. Note that these third-party dependencies are *not* under this repository's license.
